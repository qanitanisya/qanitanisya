## About WIF3005 - Software Maintenance and Evolution
As I'm taking this course in this semester, I expect to learn what and how software maintenance takes place, explore tools that's gonna be useful for maintaning a software, and how to evolve an old software that's probbaly inefficient and incompatible with modern systems. Additionally, I'm looking forward to working with other students on the team project, as it will help me improve my soft skills, which are important in professional settings.
